# Quarterly Business Report Automation

## Summary
Gathers customer quarterly Opsgenie alerts, ServiceNow tickets, and currently
alerting PRTG sensors and pushes the raw data into several Smartsheets.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Having Opsgenie, ServiceNow, and PRTG data into Smartsheets enables our team to
create custom dashboards based off customer data. This makes the process of
presenting quarterly data more streamlined to help save PMs time.

- loguru
- opsgenie_sdk
- pysnow

## Usage

  Smartsheet, and customer configuration information.

  `python quarterly_business_report_automation.py`
